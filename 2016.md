> Today, if you want to get a sensible, up-to-date python development environment, without administrative privileges, all you have to do is:

```bash
$ python -m ensurepip --user
$ python -m pip install --user --upgrade pip
$ python -m pip install --user --upgrade virtualenv
```

> Then, for each project you want to do, make a new virtualenv:
```bash
$ python -m virtualenv lets-go
$ . ./lets-go/bin/activate
(lets-go) $ _ 
```

> Need a C compiler? OS vendors have been working with the open source community to make this easier across the board:

```
$ apt install build-essential python-dev # ubuntu
$ xcode-select --install # macOS
$ dnf install @development-tools python-devel # fedora
C:\> REM windows
C:\> start https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=44266
```

> Want to upload some stuff to PyPI? This should do it for almost any project:

```
$ pip install twine
$ python setup.py sdist bdist_wheel
$ twine upload dist/*
```
> Want to build wheels for the wild and wooly world of Linux? [There’s an app](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0513/) for that.
