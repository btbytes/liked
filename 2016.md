> Today, if you want to get a sensible, up-to-date python development environment,
>  without administrative privileges, all you have to do is:

```bash
$ python -m ensurepip --user
$ python -m pip install --user --upgrade pip
$ python -m pip install --user --upgrade virtualenv
```

> Then, for each project you want to do, make a new virtualenv:
```bash
$ python -m virtualenv lets-go
$ . ./lets-go/bin/activate
(lets-go) $ _
```

> Need a C compiler? OS vendors have been working with the open source community to make this easier across the board:

```
$ apt install build-essential python-dev # ubuntu
$ xcode-select --install # macOS
$ dnf install @development-tools python-devel # fedora
C:\> REM windows
C:\> start https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=44266
```

> Want to upload some stuff to PyPI? This should do it for almost any project:

```
$ pip install twine
$ python setup.py sdist bdist_wheel
$ twine upload dist/*
```
> Want to build wheels for the wild and wooly world of Linux? [There’s an app](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0513/) for that.

- [Flow vs TypeScript](http://djcordhose.github.io/flow-vs-typescript/flow-typescript-2.html#/)  -- This presentation is a good comparison of Typescript vs Flow. However, [slide #34](http://djcordhose.github.io/flow-vs-typescript/flow-typescript-2.html#/34) makes good points about dynamically-typed languages vs statically-typed languages. Statically typed language zealots would like you to believe that Strong, Statically typed language is the only way to do anything, (especially if they are only exposed to Java).

The author says, you should consider typescript or flow:

> - if your project does not live for long: no
> - if your project is really simple: no
> - if there is a chance you will need to refactor the thing: yes
> - if your system is very important or even crucial for the success of your company: yes
> - if people enter or leave your team frequently: yes


This reminds me of [Ousterhout's dichotomy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ousterhout%27s_dichotomy).

If you have short-lived, simple, narrowly-scoped codebase that is produced and
maintained by a small team, dynamically typed languages are probably OK. But,
if one is dealing with churn in development team, your best bet is to settle
for a popular, not-too-sophisticated language (ie., Java, Typescript) and hope
for the best.

> In my experience, it is more acceptable for a humanities person to say "I'm not a science person" or "I don't like math" than for a scientist to say something similar about literature, art, or music. The latter person is thought, silently, to be a Philistine; the former, an educated person with a specialty.

> tools that take advantage of various facilities provided by the OS which allow one to isolate/restrict various resources like CPU, memory, network, visibility of other processes, filesystem access, fs layering and namespacing, provide traffic shaping, etc.

> These isolation features go back a really long time in various OS's, but only in the last few years have they seen mass adoption, which, alas is running a bit ahead of any effort to make it a formal standard or anything even close to that.

> And so the way you would create a "container" on Linux is very different from the way you'd do that on FreeBSD or Solaris or Windows. Docker was one of the first pieces of software to facilitate that on Linux (where it was and still is far from trivial), along with the whole docker image dockerhub ecosystem, etc. But ultimately what Docker does amounts to the right commands (or system calls) done, and you can have the same effect without Docker (there's even a nice Docker talk on youtube somewhere that shows how to do what Docker does without it from the command line).

> IMHO in the developer community at large few people care to understand the operating system intimately, and even fewer people know stuff like cgroups or the tc command on Linux, and that's primarily why Docker is so popular - you don't need to know any of it.

> I think it'd be nice if people stopped using "Docker" and "container" interchangeably, and if a set of tools emerged which would be more part of the OS distribution and less a separate concept/brand/company/whatever and was more or less uniform across, at least the Un*x-like OSs.
